# PWM-speed-controller-hall-throttle
Arduino code to use hall throttle with generic pwm speed controller.
This is one example of used hardware https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32853920893.html
Uses MCP4725 dac and generic hall throttle.
Hall throttle is connected to analog input A7 but can be changed to A1-A3.
Connect dac output to yellow signal input and power arduino from 3 pin connector red and black wire and check polarity before connecting.
Connect key switch between 2 pin connector with red nad black wire.
